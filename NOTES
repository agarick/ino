Summer 2018:
- See Norwegian Air's "n" in-flight magazine and fall in love with its go-to monospace. Cannot figure out the name of the face.
- Decide to make a face that resembles above.
- Love the "l", "o", "s", "t", "n", x-height. But want to improve on "j", width, bearing. Really want to implement italic and bold.
- Want to abide by geometric simplicity and coding friendliness.

18 Sep 2018:
- Name it "Ino", Agave and Autonoe's sister. Will be a learning project, as a continuation of Agave.
- Start closely studying Futura and similar geometric sans-serifs.

25 Sep 2018:
- Find out the font I had encountered is Apercu Mono.
- Decide to go ahead with design of Ino, a lookalike but with some glyphs tweaked and accompanied by different styles and weights.
- Decide to closely study Apercu, Circular, Akkurat Mono, and Replica Mono.

15 Nov 2018:
- Decide to use metapost for consistent, assured, and (hopefully) faster glyph generation.
- Start studying metafont and metapost. Feeding metapost's result into fontforge could be scripted, so only the source and feed code need to be published.

31 Aug 2019:
- Stumble upon https://github.com/hatsumatsu/Lab-Mono which looks pretty much exactly like what I wanted to make (ie. Apercu Mono).
- Decide to fallback to secondary design idea. (Which is what?)
