Summer 2018:
- Saw Norwegian Air's "n" in-flight magazine and fell in love with its go-to monospace. Cannot figure out the name of the face.
- Decide to make a face that resembles above.
- Love the "l", "o", "s", "t", "n", x-height. But want to improve on "j", width/bearing. Really want to implement italic and bold.
- Want to abide by geometric simplicity and programmer friendliness.
18 Sep 2018:
- Name it "Ino", Agave and Autonoe's sister. Will be a learning project, as a continuation of Agave.
- Start closely studying Futura and similar geometric sans-serifs.
